# waitlist

With a partner, please read over the Waitlist class. After reading through it and understanding what it currently does, implement the removeStudents method following the required time and space constraints. Also write unit tests in WaitlistTes.java. Write multiple tests! Please have commits from both partners.

At the end, one partner will make a PR, but BOTH partners must submit the same URL to receive credit.
